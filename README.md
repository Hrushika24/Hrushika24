## 👋 About Me

I'm Hrushika Papani, a **Cloud and DevOps Engineer** with over 4 years of experience in designing, automating, and securing scalable infrastructure across **AWS** and **Azure** environments. With a **Master’s in Computer Science** from the University of Missouri–Kansas City, I specialize in **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using **Terraform** and **CloudFormation**, container orchestration with **Kubernetes (EKS, AKS)**, and **CI/CD automation** using **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, and **GitLab**. My background includes large-scale **cloud migrations**, **cost optimization**, **system hardening**, and **monitoring** using tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Datadog**, and **CloudWatch**. I have supported **enterprise-grade environments** by ensuring compliance, leading **incident response**, and improving **deployment reliability** through automation and collaboration.
